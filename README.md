This project focuses on predicting heart disease using PySpark and AWS cloud services. The heart disease dataset from Kaggle was stored in AWS S3 and processed using PySpark for scalable data handling. Three machine learning models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression—were trained and evaluated. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting both achieved 100% accuracy, while Logistic Regression achieved 94%. The system also includes data visualization, model comparison, and real-time prediction capabilities using AWS EC2 and SageMaker. The project demonstrates the power of combining distributed computing with cloud infrastructure for high-performance medical prediction systems.
